# VisageVault

## Purpose:
VisageVault is a facial authentication and object identification system designed for secure and intelligent image analysis. 
Built with computer vision and machine learning at its core, this project enables facial recognition, object detection, 
and real-time decision-making across image and video data streams.


## Features
Current:
- To be implemented
- Readme
- basic setup of the environment w/ venv & gitignore

In-progress:
- Setup of Yolo8
- Setup of object identification
- Learn how AI/ML is used with Yolo8 and object identification

Future:
- Create a database for storing facial auth features as keys
- keys will be cryptography based
- deal with hash collisions
